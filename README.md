# PythonGame
This is a small game program using python as language. This program is written in order to demonstrate the use of Backtracking algorithm. 
Where backtracking algorithm is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).

# The solver.py file contains backtracking algorithm whereas the GUI.py file contains pygame module for running of game.
